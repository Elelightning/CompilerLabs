# CompilerLabs
NTU CZ3007 Compiler techniques assignments

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helloWorld141/CompilerLabs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helloWorld141/CompilerLabs)

Covered in CI:
 - Lab 1

Open Eclipse and set the workspace to `CompilerLabs/lab1` or `CompilerLabs/lab2`. Note the lowercase! There is also a nested directory `CompilerLabs/lab1/Lab1` which is the wrong directory!
